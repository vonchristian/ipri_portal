    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl text-gray-900">Criminalization </h2>
      <p class="mt-1 text-sm text-gray-600 my-4"> Defined as the misuse of criminal laws that involves the manipulation of the punitive power of the State and non-state actors in order to control, punish and/or prevent the exercise of the right to defend human rights. It can also occur when state and non-state actors use and misuse their position of power, even without using any laws/policies, to control, punish and/or prevent the exercise of Indigenous Peoples’ right to defend their individual and collective rights (E.g. trumped-up charges, red-tagging, or accusing of individuals/organizations as terrorist groups/as enemy of the State, illegal detention, etc.) </p>
